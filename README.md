# dotfiles

## Intro

In terms of software usage, I generally pertain to the following:

- **OS:** \*insert Debian or Debian-based Linux distros here\*
- **Text Editor:** Vim
- **Terminal:** Alacritty
- **Shell:** Bash
- **File Manager:** ranger
- **Browser:** Librewolf | qutebrowser
- **Email Client:** Mutt
- **PDF Viewer:** zathura
- **Image Viewer:** vimiv
- **Media Player:** mpv

I deviate from Vim to Emacs when writing Lisp code but with evil. Modes like
[SLIME](https://slime.common-lisp.dev/) and
[LispyVille](https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville) provide key bindings that
really help when working with s-expressions. I am not a hardcore Emacs user, so
wizardries such as Magit and org-mode are beyond me.

Stuff I want to try at some point:

1. i3 window manager
2. fish shell... maybe even Zsh
3. I don't use Arch btw... at least not yet >:D

## Installation

First, clone the repository as usual:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niltnir/dotfiles.git
```

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to test my installation script thoroughly,
so I can't guarantee everything will work properly. If you still want to try it
out, run:

```bash
./INSTALL
```
